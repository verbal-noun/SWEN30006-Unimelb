# SWEN30006 Unimelb

Course material for Software Modelling and Design (SWEN30006) for year 2020, Semester 2.

A somewhat practical core subject and made very very fun by my awesome teammates:

- [Khant Thurien Han (Leo)](https://github.com/xlelx)
- [Andrew Shen](https://github.com/Redrew)

**Tips for future students**: You'll be spending a lot of time with your group in workshops and projects so choose them carefully. The teamwork and communication is the core of the subject.
